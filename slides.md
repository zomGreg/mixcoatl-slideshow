# Background

As the Dell Cloud Manager API matured, it became clear there was an opportunity
to expose programmatic access to multiple clouds via a single set of
command-line tools in the same way the DCM user interface allows for
pointing-and-clicking.

## Vision

Think [EC2 API Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/developertools/351) for *every*
cloud DCM supports. 

(Spoiler alert: that's cool)
!SLIDE left

# Purpose

The Mixcoatl project was started to wrap the DCM API and make it easy to use.

## Why?

Getting started with API can be a daunting task, and Mixcoatl lowers the
barrier-to-entry.

1. Handles Authentication
2. Out-of-the-box functionality

# Installation

The mixcoatl installation process was designed to be simple.

## Recommended Requirements

1. OS X / Linux (Not tested in windows, although theoretically it should work)
2. [Python Pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)
3. DCM API Credentials

# Usage

Mixcoatl can be used as a Python module by importing:

```

>>> from mixcoatl.geography.cloud import Cloud
>>> c = Cloud(1)
>>> # returns immediately
>>> c.cloud_id
1
>>> c.name
>>> # api call is made.
u'Amazon Web Services'

```

Mixcoatl is used today to facilitate the setting up of release candidate environments:

```

from mixcoatl.resource import Resource
from mixcoatl.admin.account import Account

```

It is being used to automate the addition of cloud accounts to a newly installed DCM system.

# Usage

Mixcoatl ships with 53 utilities, grouped roughly into categories:

1. List (general form: `dcm-list-<something>`)
   * Example `dcm-list-accounts`
2. Create (general form: `dcm-create-<something>`)
   * Example `dcm-create-billing-code`
3. Describe (general form: `dcm-describe-<something> <ID>`)
   * Example `dcm-describe-server 4099`
4. Delete (general form: `dcm-delete-<something> <ID>`)
   * Example `dcm-delete-server 4099`

Other forms include `attach`, `update`, `start`, `stop`, depending on the resource type.
