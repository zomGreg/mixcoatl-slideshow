# Background

As the Dell Cloud Manager API matured, it became clear there was an opportunity
to expose programmatic access to multiple clouds via a single set of
command-line tools in the same way the DCM user interface allows for
pointing-and-clicking.

## Vision

Think [EC2 API Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/developertools/351) for *every*
cloud DCM supports. 

(Spoiler alert: that's cool)
